# Character Profile: Hanae

## Basic Information
- **Name:** Tamami Hanae
- **Gender:** Female
- **Appearance:** Dark hair, brown eyes. Moderately tall for a woman. Neither thin nor fat, nothing particularly outstanding. A very plain and ordinary look.
- **Background:** Born in rural Japan. Grew up with dreams of being a magical girl, later shifted to wanting to be an idol. Abandoned both as unrealistic and became a teacher.

## Personality
- **Core Traits:** Idealistic, but disillusioned and tired from her own high standards for herself and others.  
- **Strengths:** Strong heart, innate leadership qualities, unwavering when faced with a moral decision.  
- **Weaknesses:** Deep insecurity about being “too old” and “too plain” compared to others. Feels like a “country pumpkin” in the city.  
- **Social Role:** Constantly teased by the younger girls (especially Torey). Self-conscious, but endures it with quiet strength.

## Magical Girl Form
- **Codename:** Yumeno Apollonia
- **Transformation Concept:** Takes the shape of her old dream — an idol.
- **Animal Companion:** Love, The Cat.
- **Weapons:**  
  - Suitcase → Drum (used as shield)  
  - Microphone → Sword (idol’s tool turned weapon)  
- **Abilities:**  
  - Enhanced strength  
  - Moderate speed  
  - High resilience  
  - Leadership that helps coordinate allies in combat  
- **Unique Power:**  
  - **Rhythm Sense** — can perceive rhythm in all things (movement, flow of battle, possibly intent). Over time, learns to subtly manipulate it.  

## Awakened Form
- **Core Power:** Full rhythm mastery → **control of time**.  
- **Symbolism:** Her weapon is time because she is always painfully aware of it passing — her age, her missed dreams, her fear of being left behind.  
- **Effects in Battle:**  
  - Appears to “multiply” into afterimages.  
  - Moves in ways that confuse her enemy’s perception of time.  
  - Creates overwhelming “noise” with her multiplied presence, able to destroy enemies.  
  - To bystanders, what looks like a drawn-out fight actually happens in less than a second.  
- **Limitations:** Extremely draining; she collapses after use. First appears in the opening chapter and then lies dormant for a long time.  

## Story Role
- Becomes the leader of the Human Rangers due to her natural sense of responsibility and heart.  
- Represents the “plain” individual whose strength is hidden until pushed.  
- Her insecurities and awareness of time fuel her power: what she fears most
becomes her greatest weapon.
